<h1>Favorite movies according to Panagiotis.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>SEVEN</h3>
<p>Exceptional mystery/thriller.Dark and depressing but just fascinating.What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming.</p>
<h3>Fury</h3>
<p>A WWII film wich a film that captures how the situation was in 1945.</p>
